# NeuralNetworksMatlab
From single Perceptrons to Deep Learning Networks

The directories of this repository include code from assignments of the course 
Neural Networks for Machine Learning offered by University of Toronto and Proffessor 
Geoffrey Hinton through Coursera platform.

The code have been enhanced with my modifications to a given template 
as also guidance for future educational purposes.
